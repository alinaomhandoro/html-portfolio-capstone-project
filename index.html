<h3>Professional Profile:</h3>

<p>I'm a content manager and training specialist with 20 years of experience in customer service, recruiting, training, and 
    content management. I have experience in collaborating with medium and large companies, providing customer service, moderation, 
    full-cycle recruiting, training, market research, social media, reporting, and content management services. After two decades, 
    I decided it was time for new challenges and a career change. I looked into web development and AWS Cloud and decided to dive into both! 
    This Resume is my first capstone project on my web development journey.</p>
